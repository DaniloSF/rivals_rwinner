# Rivals of Aether Winner Detector

This project is a tool for detecting the winner in the game Rivals of Aether. It uses DLL injection to monitor the game process and sends the result to a specified address.

## How it works

The tool first finds the game process, then injects a DLL into it. It sets up two TCP listeners for debug and data, and optionally a TCP sender to send data to another address.

The tool reads data from the game process, converts it to a number representing the winner, and sends this data to the TCP sender if it's set up.

## Usage

To use this tool, run the executable in the same directory as the DLL to be injected (`rivals_rwinner.dll`). The tool will automatically find the game process and start monitoring it.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following crates:

- `dll_syringe` for DLL injection
- `retour` for detouring functions
- `color_eyre` for error reporting
- `tracing` for logging

## Configuration

The project includes a `config.ini` file where you can customize the tool's behavior. This file is automatically generated if it doesn't exist. It includes the following sections:

- `internal_data`: This section is used to configure the TCP listener for data. It includes the following settings:
  - `tcp_ip`: The IP address for the data listener. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
  - `tcp_port`: The port for the data listener. Default is `4555`.

- `internal_debug`: This section is used to configure the TCP listener for debug information. It includes the following settings:
  - `tcp_ip`: The IP address for the debug listener. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
  - `tcp_port`: The port for the debug listener. Default is `4556`.

- `conn`: This section is used to configure the TCP sender. It includes the following settings:
  - `tcp_ip`: The IP address to send data to. Default is `127.0.0.1`.
  - `tcp_port`: The port to send data to. Default is `5005`.

You can modify these settings as per your requirements. If the `config.ini` file is not found in the same directory as the executable, the tool will create a new one with default settings.
